During the PMP training with Dream Youth International, real life scenarios were painted for us to learn and this facilitated creative thinking and application. Sincerely, not even my 5-year B.SC classes in Computer Engineering can be compared to the 35 contact hour classes I received during this training. The training was truly fruitful and I recommend it for everyone regardless of the discipline of study\".\r\n                                                                                                                            Jaiyeola David Dideolu,\r\n                                                                                                                            CU Graduate\r\n                                </Paragraph>\r\n                            </Pane>\r\n\r\n                            <Pane\r\n                                elevation={4}\r\n                                backgroundColor=\"black\"\r\n                                height={470}\r\n                                color=\"white\"\r\n                                width={\"100%\"}\r\n                                margin={24}\r\n                                padding={15}\r\n                                borderRadius={10}\r\n                                flexDirection=\"column\"\r\n                                align=\"justify\"\r\n                                display=\"flex\"\r\n                                alignItems=\"center\"\r\n                                justifyContent=\"center\"\r\n                                border=\"default\"\r\n\r\n                            >\r\n                                <img src={tomi} align=\"left\" className=\"arausi\"/>\r\n                                <Paragraph size={400} \r\n                                fontSize=\"1vw\"\r\n                                marginTop=\"default\" style={{width: \"auto\", color: \"white\"}}>\"PMP Training with Dream Youth International was amazing!

Content and presentation by the facilitator was consistently high quality and engaging. Most importantly, each session provided an excellent review of the challenges and opportunity inherent in each area - while challenging us to clarify and to find our own answers. I feel that the techniques used, the real life examples, the power-point were extremely good. At no point did I feel that the training was long or dragging on. Even after breaks/lunch, I felt that there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm. It is great to have a certified Project Management Professional with so much energy. I felt challenged and consistently drawn into the exercise and presentations had my full attention due to the way in which they were conducted.
