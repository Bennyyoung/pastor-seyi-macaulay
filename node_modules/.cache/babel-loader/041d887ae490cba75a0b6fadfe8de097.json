Content and presentation by the facilitator was consistently high quality and engaging. Most importantly, each session provided an excellent review of the challenges and opportunity inherent in each area - while challenging us to clarify and to find our own answers. I feel that the techniques used, the real life examples, the power-point were extremely good. At no point did I feel that the training was long or dragging on. Even after breaks/lunch, I felt that there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm. It is great to have a certified Project Management Professional with so much energy. I felt challenged and consistently drawn into the exercise and presentations had my full attention due to the way in which they were conducted. I found the course very useful and will hopefully be able to put it into practice.
