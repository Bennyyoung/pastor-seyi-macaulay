During the PMP training with Dream Youth International, real life scenarios were painted for us to learn and this facilitated creative thinking and application. Sincerely, not even my 5-year B.SC classes in Computer Engineering can be compared to the 35 contact hour classes I received during this training. The training was truly fruitful and I recommend it for everyone regardless of the discipline of study\".\r\n                                                                                                                            Jaiyeola David Dideolu,\r\n                                                                                                                            CU Graduate\r\n                                </Paragraph>\r\n                            </Pane>\r\n\r\n                            <Pane\r\n                                elevation={4}\r\n                                backgroundColor=\"black\"\r\n                                height={470}\r\n                                color=\"white\"\r\n                                width={\"100%\"}\r\n                                margin={24}\r\n                                padding={15}\r\n                                borderRadius={10}\r\n                                flexDirection=\"column\"\r\n                                align=\"justify\"\r\n                                display=\"flex\"\r\n                                alignItems=\"center\"\r\n                                justifyContent=\"center\"\r\n                                border=\"default\"\r\n\r\n                            >\r\n                                <img src={tomi} align=\"left\" className=\"arausi\"/>\r\n                                <Paragraph size={400} marginTop=\"default\" style={{width: \"auto\", color: \"white\"}}>\"PMP Training with Dream Youth International was amazing!

Most importantly, each session provided an excellent review of the challenges and opportunity inherent in each area - while challenging us to clarify and to find our own answers.
